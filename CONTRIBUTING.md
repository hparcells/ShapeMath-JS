# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change. 

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write your new code and add tests if needed.
3. Ensure that all tests run successfully. 
4. Create a pull request with the pull request template.

## Report bugs using GitHub's Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hparcells/ShapeMath-JS/issues/new/choose); it's that easy! Make sure to use the bug report template!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).
