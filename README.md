A JavaScript Library of Math Functions for 2D and 3D Shapes.

## Installing
1. Run `npm install shapemath-js`.
2. Require the Package Using `const shapemath = require("shapemath-js");`.
3. Do Math!

## Doing Math
Once you require the package, you can start doing math. We can find the area of a square for example by doing, `shapemath.square.area(10)`. This would return a value of 10. You can store this in a variable or use it in a function. For example, `console.log(shapemath.square.area(131.2));` would print out, "10"

You can see all the possible functions on the documentation pages which are comming soon!
