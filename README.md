A JavaScript Library of Math Functions for 2D and 3D Shapes.

## Installing
1. Run `npm install shapemath-js`.
2. Require the Package Using `const shapemath = require("shapemath-js");`.
3. Do Math!

## Doing Math
Once you require the package, you can start doing math. We can find the area of a square for example by doing, `shapemath.square.area(5)`. This would return a value of 25, where 5 is the side length. You can store this in a variable or use it in a function. For example, `console.log(shapemath.square.area(5));` would print out, "25"

You can see all the possible functions on the documentation pages which are coming soon!
The webpage is already created [here](https://shapemathjsdocs.netlify.com/) so you can see as it gets updated.

## Roadmap
- More 2D Shapes (Soon)
- More Complex Math for Shapes (Later)
- 3D Shapes (Soon)
- Documentation (Soon)
